# rot

A customizable rotation cipher.  
Made by anson in 2024.

This program can accept input from a pipe and also by a
file passed in arguments. By default, this program uses
the ROT47 and outputs to standard output, but can be
configured to use different rotation ciphers, such as
Caesar and ROT13, as well as output to a file.

The short version of the command-line arguments can be combined together,
and both short and long arguments can be mixed together. If not
accepting input from a pipe or file, this program will not run.

Usage and options can be read by invoking `rot --help` at the
command line. This project is licensed under the MIT License, see LICENSE for
